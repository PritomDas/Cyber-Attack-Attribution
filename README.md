<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Research Project

### Project Description

Cyber attack attribution is the process of attempting to trace back a piece of code or malware to a perpetrator of a cyberattack. As cyber attacks have become more prevalent, cyber attack attribution becomes more valuable. The process of cyber attack attribution can be done using reverse engineering. From the metadata of the malware executable file, we can gather data such as date of creation, variable names used, and what library calls are imported. This information can be used as features for attribution analysis. We need to extract the features from malware that can be used for attribution and analyse them using some technique to attribute the attacks. 

### Motivation

Our interest stems from the increase in recent cyber attacks. It is important to analyse the malware and get its artifacts which can give us a hint of the attacker. Cyber attacks will only become more prominent as time goes on and as our society becomes more dependent on our technological infrastructure. Cyber attack attribution will be a key element in combating malware development by helping to classify the malware by type, authorship, and other key categories. This is especially useful when you consider state-sponsored malware. It is becoming imperative to be able to identify the authorship of the malware as well as the country the malware comes from because cyber warfare will eclipse traditional combat warfare in the future. Our team has experience with machine learning algorithms and is proficient with Python.

## Literature Review

### DeepAPT: Nation-State APT Attribution UsingEnd-to-End Deep Neural Networks
The authors here describe how the nation-state APT can be attributed by using its dynamic analysis as raw input to a deep neural network (DNN) allowing it to learn high level feature abstractions of the APTs itself. The nation-state APT problem is more complex since a nation may have many cyber units with different targets, functionality and framework. Therefore, the author attribution approach will not work. APT’s cannot be classified based only on frameworks and functionality. The authors used the Cuckoo Sandbox reports of samples of APT which were allegedly developed by nation-states as input to DNN. The DNN had a 10 layer fully connected network. The classifier achieved an accuracy of 94.6%. The authors concluded different nation-states use different APT developing methodologies, such that the works of developers in separate cyber units are still sufficiently similar to each other.

### MVFCC: A Multi-View Fuzzy Consensus Clustering Model for Malware Threat Attribution
The authors proposed a multi-view fuzzy consensus clustering model for attributing malware. The authors used the Cuckoo sandbox reports for the malware samples and converted the report for each malware to different views in four categories  namely Opcode, Bytecode, SystemCall and Header. The opcode and bytecode consists of the Binary, count, Frequency of occurrence, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency and Eigen Vector modes. The authors then fuzzified each feature of all views using Trapezoidal and Triangular fuzzifier. They next used the Fuzzy Pattern tree (FPT) classification algorithm on views. FPT will result in a set of k (k= no of APT groups)classifiers being trained on each view. The authors now applied Fuzzy C-Means partitioning technique to divide malware in each APT group to several clusters. Classification and clustering provided a database of fuzzy metrics on which a decision tree was trained to provide the APT group for the malware sample. The decision tree aggregates information from different fuzzy learning algorithms. The authors were able to attribute malware samples to its APT actors correctly with 95% of accuracy. Therefore, a malicious actor needs to change all possible properties of the malware  to evade or fool the MVFCC

### Applying Supervised Learning on Malware Authorship Attribution
The authors of these papers proposed a method to attribute state-sponsored authorship of malware using the supervised learning approaches Ro18 and Am17. Ro18 is a supervised learning technique that analyzes malware reports generated by Cuckoo Sandbox and inputs it into a deep neural network in order to classify state-sponsored malware. Am17 is similar to Ro18, but focuses on family classification of criminal malware instead of just state-sponsored malware, and it uses a random forest classifier instead of a DNN. The results from Ro18 when given a scenario of unseen APT groups showed that the accuracy of the classifiers was highly dependent on the sandbox reports that were used. On the other hand, when working with samples of earlier seen APT groups, the DNN works much better overall, regardless of the sandbox environment used. When using Am17, the results with unseen APT groups are worse than the DNN solution, while working with seen APT groups yields similarly good results. https://github.com/cyber-research/APTMalware

### Deep learning based Sequential model for malware analysis using Windows exe API Calls
The authors experimented with classifying malware using a sequential model machine learning technique in a Cuckoo sandbox environment. The Long-Short Term model learning method was chosen because it allows long term dependency to be detected at random intervals. Using multiple malware datasets, they were able to test the LSTM model, but also develop data on API calls for Windows OS malware. To do so, they first started with filtering out rows that did not have 10 or more API calls. Next, they compared the hash values given by VirusTotal with the hash values of each of the malware samples to try and classify its type. Lastly, they used the joint data of the API call sequence and the malware classification to create and train a dataset. For this, decision trees, k-clustering, and support vector machines methods were used. The authors were able to test and classify malware behavior for 7107 Windows software samples. The success rate was between 83.5% and 98.5% with performance not being an issue. Although this experiment was more of a proof of concept, it did provide more insight of Windows API calls and malware correlation, as well as a dataset pertaining to this work.


### The Power of Threat Attribution- Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine
Tracking, analyzing, interpreting and mitigating constantly evolving IT security threats is a massive undertaking. Threat intelligence (TI) has true value beyond the current hype around an emerging pocket in the information security industry. TI includes a number of different services that help organizations stay protected, increase awareness and assist with investigations. When it comes to threat intelligence, threat attribution is probably the most visible process and also a point of contention. And there is a definite reason for this. The average time from detection to response against highly sophisticated threats is usually too long due to complex investigation and reverse engineering processes. Today, in the digital era, organizations are obliged to instantly investigate, prioritize all alerts and accelerate the time to respond. Correct and timely attribution helps not only to shorten incident response times from hours to minutes but also to reduce the number of false positives. Attributing targeted attacks is a powerful and essential tool that: Evaluates if you are a target or an unintended victim, Provides insights into the actors behind the attack and their motivation, Enables effective detection, investigation, containment and response based on the  knowledge of the tactics, techniques and procedures specific to the threat actor. 
Some major threat attribution techniques are (1)Timestamps:One major benefit of the Portable Execution (PE) format is that compilation times are always included. Though they can be easily altered, many samples have the original timestamps. There are a few important indicators that timestamps can show. (2)Strings, debug paths and metadata: Implanted binary code can also expose interesting details about the authors. The artifacts include their preferred language as well as debug paths, which often reveal a username, as well as internal naming conventions for internal tools, projects or campaigns. Also metadata that might reveal the configuration of the developer’s system. (3)Infrastructure and backend: infrastructure reuse is the most telling sign that an attacker is resurfacing or retooling. When attackers retrieve data from the email account of an exfiltration server, prepare staging or phishing servers or check on the availability of a compromised domain, they almost always use an anonymizing service. (4)Exploits: Zero-day exploits are a great source of details about the actor behind an attack. The presence of a “0-day” immediately sets an actor apart from ordinary attackers. (5)Targeted victim: Though many indicators may be faked or altered, the dynamic between attacker and victim is harder to hide or directly manipulate as it involves ‘real-world’ publicly known circumstances or geopolitical conflicts. This insight allows for attacker profiling. A possible outcome is the mapping of a campaign to a geopolitical or regional situation that may point in the direction of a given perpetrating organization or nation. 

### When Coding Style Survives Compilation: De-anonymizing Programmers from Executable Binaries
There is a way to identify authors of a computer program based on their coding style: variable names, spacing, etc… It has been shown that source code can be attributed to authors with high accuracy, although attribution of executable binaries seem to be a lot more difficult. They used machine learning to find patterns and they decompiled the executable binary to source code. They evaluated their approach from data from Google Code Jam and had an attribution accuracy of up to 96%. This is preserved in the compilation process and this can be extracted from the executable binary. It may be possible to infer the  programers identity if we have a set of KNOWN potential candidate programmers, along with executable finary samples known to be authored by these candidates. This has a forensics application as they can consistently identify virtual personas and individual malicious cyber operators over time. We see hackers try to obscure their binaries so it cannot be traced back to them although we find that traditional binary obfuscation, enabling compiler optimizations, or stripping debugging symbols in executable binaries results in only a modest decrease in de-anonymization accuracy.We emphasize that research challenges remain before programmer de-anonymization from executable binaries is fully ready for practical use. For example, programs may be authored by multiple programmers and may have gone through encryption. They approach this problem using supervised machine learning, that is, we generate a classifier from training data of sample executable binaries with known authors. A drawback is that the method is inoperable if samples are not available or too short to represent authorial style.


## Technical Approach
First, our team identified a GitHub repository of pre-classified state sponsored malware that we will be using as our dataset. We then performed static analysis on the malware samples. We didn’t go for dynamic analysis since the setup of Cuckoo would take a lot of time and the accuracy of static analysis was very good. We didn’t use any specific environment for malware analysis, since we didn’t perform dynamic analysis and there was no need to execute the malware samples. We have generated the VirusTotal reports for the malware samples. We have fetched various attributes from the VirusTotal reports and use those attributes as inputs to our Random Forest Algorithm.

### Data Gathering
As we mentioned in the initial project proposal, during our research we found a repository in Github ( https://github.com/cyber-research/APTMalware)  that contained about 4,500 country-sponsored malware samples [3] that we decided to use as our dataset. We also have access to the VirusTotal Developers API and have created a script that will send the hash value of all malware samples to the VirusTotal API and download the reports for all malwares as a json file.

### Data Classification, Extraction, and Use
Since we plan on doing static analysis, we needed to consider whether the malwares were packed or not. Packing is a form of code obfuscation that modifies the format of the malware by compressing or encrypting the data, so we would not be able to extract the artifacts we need without putting the malware through some type of unpacking software. Because of this, we used a tool called PEiD that can detect whether or not a malware sample is packed and classified all of our malware into either unpacked or packed categories. The number of packed and unpacked malwares per APT group are summarized in the table below (Fig 1). We have only used unpacked malware samples for attribution to APT Group. The number of unpacked malware samples are 3591.

We have extracted the following attributes from the VirusTotal reports for each malware sample
pe-resource-langs
imports
pe-entry-points

We created a python script that would extract the above attributes from each of the json malware report  files and consolidate it into one csv file.We created a CSV  file with the above three attributes , resource (i.e hash of the malware) and APT group columns which we fetched from the GitHub repository. Please see a snapshot of unprocessed dataset below.(Fig 2).

#### Log Dataset

Logs dataset is generated by [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim). These log files in JSON format simulate activity logs from a music streaming application based on specified configurations. The dataset is hosted at S3 bucket `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`.

Sample Record :

```
{"artist": null, "auth": "Logged In", "firstName": "Walter", "gender": "M", "itemInSession": 0, "lastName": "Frye", "length": null, "level": "free", "location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA", "method": "GET","page": "Home", "registration": 1540919166796.0, "sessionId": 38, "song": null, "status": 200, "ts": 1541105830796, "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"", "userId": "39"}
```



## Database Schema Design

### Data Model ERD

The Star Database Schema (Fact and Dimension Schema) is used for data modeling in this ETL pipeline. There is one fact table containing all the metrics (facts) associated to each event (user actions), and four dimensions tables, containing associated information such as user name, artist name, song meta-data etc. This model enables to search the database schema with the minimum number of *SQL JOIN*s possible and enable fast read queries. 

The data stored on S3 buckets is staged and then inserted to fact and dimensional tables on Redshift. The whole process in orchestrated using Airflow which is set to execute periodically once every hour.

## Apache Airflow Orchestration 

### DAG Structure

The DAG parameters are set according to the following :

- The DAG does not have dependencies on past runs
- DAG has schedule interval set to hourly
- On failure, the task are retried 3 times
- Retries happen every 5 minutes
- Catchup is turned off
- Email are not sent on retry

The DAG dependency graph is given below.

![dag](./images/dag.png)

### Operators

Operators create necessary tables, stage the data, transform the data, and run checks on data quality. Connections and Hooks are configured using Airflow's built-in functionalities. All of the operators and task run SQL statements against the Redshift database. 

#### Stage Operator
The stage operator loads any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. The operator's parameters specify where in S3, the file is loaded and what is the target table.

- **Task to stage JSON data is included in the DAG and uses the RedshiftStage operator**: There is a task that to stages data from S3 to Redshift (Runs a Redshift copy statement).

- **Task uses params**: Instead of running a static SQL statement to stage the data, the task uses parameters to generate the copy statement dynamically. It also contains a templated field that allows it to load timestamped files from S3 based on the execution time and run backfills.

- **Logging used**: The operator contains logging in different steps of the execution.

- **The database connection is created by using a hook and a connection**: The SQL statements are executed by using a Airflow hook.

#### Fact and Dimension Operators
The dimension and fact operators make use of the SQL helper class to run data transformations. Operators take as input the SQL statement from the helper class and target the database on which to run the query against. A target table is also defined that contains the results of the transformation.

Dimension loads are done with the truncate-insert pattern where the target table is emptied before the load. There is a parameter that allows switching between insert modes when loading dimensions. Fact tables are massive so they only allow append type functionality.

- **Set of tasks using the dimension load operator is in the DAG**: Dimensions are loaded with on the LoadDimension operator.

- **A task using the fact load operator is in the DAG**: Facts are loaded with on the LoadFact operator.

- **Both operators use params**: Instead of running a static SQL statement to stage the data, the task uses parameters to generate the copy statement dynamically.

- **The dimension task contains a param to allow switch between append and insert-delete functionality**: The DAG allows to switch between append-only and delete-load functionality.

#### Data Quality Operator
The data quality operator is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each the test, the test result and expected result are checked and if there is no match, the operator raises an exception and the task is retried and fails eventually.

For example one test could be a SQL statement that checks if certain column contains NULL values by counting all the rows that have NULL in the column. We do not want to have any NULLs so expected result would be 0 and the test would compare the SQL statement's outcome to the expected result.

- **A task using the data quality operator is in the DAG and at least one data quality check is done**: Data quality check is done with correct operator.

- **The operator raises an error if the check fails**: The DAG either fails or retries n times.

- **The operator is parametrized**: Operator uses params to get the tests and the results, tests are not hard coded to the operator.


### Airflow UI views of DAG and plugins

The DAG follows the data flow provided in the instructions, all the tasks have a dependency and DAG begins with a start_execution task and ends with a end_execution task.
