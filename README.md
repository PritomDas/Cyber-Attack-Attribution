<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Research Project

### Project Description

Cyber attack attribution is the process of attempting to trace back a piece of code or malware to a perpetrator of a cyberattack. As cyber attacks have become more prevalent, cyber attack attribution becomes more valuable. The process of cyber attack attribution can be done using reverse engineering. From the metadata of the malware executable file, we can gather data such as date of creation, variable names used, and what library calls are imported. This information can be used as features for attribution analysis. We need to extract the features from malware that can be used for attribution and analyse them using some technique to attribute the attacks. 

### Motivation

Our interest stems from the increase in recent cyber attacks. It is important to analyse the malware and get its artifacts which can give us a hint of the attacker. Cyber attacks will only become more prominent as time goes on and as our society becomes more dependent on our technological infrastructure. Cyber attack attribution will be a key element in combating malware development by helping to classify the malware by type, authorship, and other key categories. This is especially useful when you consider state-sponsored malware. It is becoming imperative to be able to identify the authorship of the malware as well as the country the malware comes from because cyber warfare will eclipse traditional combat warfare in the future. Our team has experience with machine learning algorithms and is proficient with Python.

## Literature Review

We plan to use machine learning to attribute a nation-state sponsored malware to an APT group. The malware samples will be retrieved from GitHub repositories we find during research. We will generate reports of these malwares using the VirusTotal API. We will extract various attributes from the VirusTotal reports and use them as an input to our machine learning agent to get the attribution result, which then be utilized to classify the malware into different APT groups. The justification we have for this approach comes from the research paper “Applying Supervised Learning on Malware Authorship Attribution” and other papers noted in our included Lit review. The authors of these papers classify state sponsored malware into countries and API groups by using the reports generated by various sandbox environments.

### Dataset

#### Song Dataset

Songs dataset is a subset of [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file in the dataset is in JSON format and contains meta-data about a song and the artist of that song. The dataset is hosted at S3 bucket `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`.

Sample Record :

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

#### Log Dataset

Logs dataset is generated by [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim). These log files in JSON format simulate activity logs from a music streaming application based on specified configurations. The dataset is hosted at S3 bucket `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`.

Sample Record :

```
{"artist": null, "auth": "Logged In", "firstName": "Walter", "gender": "M", "itemInSession": 0, "lastName": "Frye", "length": null, "level": "free", "location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA", "method": "GET","page": "Home", "registration": 1540919166796.0, "sessionId": 38, "song": null, "status": 200, "ts": 1541105830796, "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"", "userId": "39"}
```



## Database Schema Design

### Data Model ERD

The Star Database Schema (Fact and Dimension Schema) is used for data modeling in this ETL pipeline. There is one fact table containing all the metrics (facts) associated to each event (user actions), and four dimensions tables, containing associated information such as user name, artist name, song meta-data etc. This model enables to search the database schema with the minimum number of *SQL JOIN*s possible and enable fast read queries. 

The data stored on S3 buckets is staged and then inserted to fact and dimensional tables on Redshift. The whole process in orchestrated using Airflow which is set to execute periodically once every hour.

## Apache Airflow Orchestration 

### DAG Structure

The DAG parameters are set according to the following :

- The DAG does not have dependencies on past runs
- DAG has schedule interval set to hourly
- On failure, the task are retried 3 times
- Retries happen every 5 minutes
- Catchup is turned off
- Email are not sent on retry

The DAG dependency graph is given below.

### Operators

Operators create necessary tables, stage the data, transform the data, and run checks on data quality. Connections and Hooks are configured using Airflow's built-in functionalities. All of the operators and task run SQL statements against the Redshift database. 

#### Stage Operator
The stage operator loads any JSON formatted files from S3 to Amazon Redshift. The operator creates and runs a SQL COPY statement based on the parameters provided. The operator's parameters specify where in S3, the file is loaded and what is the target table.

- **Task to stage JSON data is included in the DAG and uses the RedshiftStage operator**: There is a task that to stages data from S3 to Redshift (Runs a Redshift copy statement).

- **Task uses params**: Instead of running a static SQL statement to stage the data, the task uses parameters to generate the copy statement dynamically. It also contains a templated field that allows it to load timestamped files from S3 based on the execution time and run backfills.

- **Logging used**: The operator contains logging in different steps of the execution.

- **The database connection is created by using a hook and a connection**: The SQL statements are executed by using a Airflow hook.

#### Fact and Dimension Operators
The dimension and fact operators make use of the SQL helper class to run data transformations. Operators take as input the SQL statement from the helper class and target the database on which to run the query against. A target table is also defined that contains the results of the transformation.

Dimension loads are done with the truncate-insert pattern where the target table is emptied before the load. There is a parameter that allows switching between insert modes when loading dimensions. Fact tables are massive so they only allow append type functionality.

- **Set of tasks using the dimension load operator is in the DAG**: Dimensions are loaded with on the LoadDimension operator.

- **A task using the fact load operator is in the DAG**: Facts are loaded with on the LoadFact operator.

- **Both operators use params**: Instead of running a static SQL statement to stage the data, the task uses parameters to generate the copy statement dynamically.

- **The dimension task contains a param to allow switch between append and insert-delete functionality**: The DAG allows to switch between append-only and delete-load functionality.

#### Data Quality Operator
The data quality operator is used to run checks on the data itself. The operator's main functionality is to receive one or more SQL based test cases along with the expected results and execute the tests. For each the test, the test result and expected result are checked and if there is no match, the operator raises an exception and the task is retried and fails eventually.

For example one test could be a SQL statement that checks if certain column contains NULL values by counting all the rows that have NULL in the column. We do not want to have any NULLs so expected result would be 0 and the test would compare the SQL statement's outcome to the expected result.

- **A task using the data quality operator is in the DAG and at least one data quality check is done**: Data quality check is done with correct operator.

- **The operator raises an error if the check fails**: The DAG either fails or retries n times.

- **The operator is parametrized**: Operator uses params to get the tests and the results, tests are not hard coded to the operator.


### Airflow UI views of DAG and plugins

The DAG follows the data flow provided in the instructions, all the tasks have a dependency and DAG begins with a start_execution task and ends with a end_execution task.
